I can't believe I'm standing here  
Been waiting for so many years and  
Today I found the Queen to reign my heart  
You changed my life so patiently  
And turned it into somthing good and real  
I feel just like I felt in all my dreams  
There are questions hard to answer  
Can't you see  

Baby tell me how can I tell you  
That I love you more than life  
Show me how can I show you  
That I'm blinded by your light  
When you touch me I can touch you  
To find out the dream is true  
I love to be loved by you  

You're looking kind of scared right now  
You're waiting for the wedding vows but  
I don't know if my tongue's able to talk  
Your beauty is just blinding me  
Like sunbeams on a summer stream and  
I gotta close my eyes to protect me   
Can you take my hand and lead me from here please  
yeah... yeah...    

Baby tell me how can I tell you  
That I love you more than life  
Show me how can I show you  
That I'm blinded by your light  
When you touch me I can touch you  
To find out the dream is true  
I love to be loved  
I need to be loved  
I love to be loved by you  
I know they're gotta say our love's not strong enough to last forever  
And I know they're gonna say that we'll give up because of heavy weather  
But how can they understand  
that our love is just heaven-sent  
We keep on going on and on  
Cause this is where we both belong
